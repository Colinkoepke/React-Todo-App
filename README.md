# My React TODO App ###### I know, really original

This is a very simple todo app I created with react. You can: Add pending tasks, complete/remove pending tasks, and then remove the completed tasks from the list of completed tasks if you please. 

Right now this app consits of:
- Simple react components (some Class components with lifecycle hooks and some functional with React Hooks)
- Routing (with react-router-dom)
- Simple animations when adding/removing list items (using react-transition-group)

Looking to add:
- Redux (I know this isn't needed for an app of this size, but it will be good practice)
- Authentication
- DB usage/accessing an endpoint via axios
- Add responsiveness/fix this awful styling
- Researching graphQL
